Flag format: picoCTF{Malwarename} The first letter of the malware name should be capitalized and the rest lowercase. Your friend just got hacked and has been asked to pay some bitcoins to `1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX`. He doesn’t seem to understand what is going on and asks you for advice. Can you identify what malware he’s being a victim of?

## Pistas
Some crypto-currencies abuse databases exist; check them out!

Maybe Google might help.
